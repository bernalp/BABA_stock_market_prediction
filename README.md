## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

I developed this project using Python 3.11.3 and list libraries that I've been used are:

    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler
    - tensorflow
    - tensorflow.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping
    - sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error
    - sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error
    - sklearn.metrics.r2_score
    - sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_percentage_error

These libraries have been used for various purposes throughout the project, including data analysis, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In this stock price prediction project for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA). I aim to forecast the future stock prices based on historical data. By utilizing a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model, we can make predictions and evaluate the accuracy of the model's performance. Here are the key questions to address:

- Q1: How accurately can we predict BABA stock prices using the available data?
- Q2: How well does the predictive model perform in identifying upward or downward trends in stock prices?
- Q3: Can we optimize the predictive model to improve its accuracy and reliability?

To measure success of this project, I'll consider following criteria:

- Clear answers to all questions listed related to BABA stock price prediction.
- Development machine learning model that can predict BABA stock prices based on available data.
- Improvement on predictive model to achieve better accuracy in predicting stock prices.
- Evaluation model performance in identifying BABA stock prices.
- Summarize model effectiveness and recommendations to improve the prediction accuracy.

By obtain valuable insights and develop reliable predictive model, we'll aim to make informed decisions in forecasting stock prices.
